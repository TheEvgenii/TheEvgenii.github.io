							<h2>2D Game C.A.K.E.Z. 2<br/>
							</h2>
							<p>This game design document describes the details for a 2D run and gun PC game with an original story and characters. The objective of the game is to escape a stinky, toxic, gas-filled laboratory building that was caused by an explosion. We decided to name our game "P.U." based on the common exclamation used by most people when caught in a smelly situation. The term is derived from the latin "Puteo", which means "stink" or "rotten" and is reflected in the gameplay as the stink bomb that infects the laboratory building.</p>

								<h2>Method and Algorithms for Searching Object in Video Stream with Compression in Video Surveillance System <br />
								</h2>
								<p>In this research paper I am working closely with Dr. Shishir and Dr. Mantini on the distributed video systems and optimizations. General solutions for detecting objects in a video stream will be considered. The level of intelligence of video surveillance systems focuses only on moving objects. The new technology should compress video quality as much as possible with a still background image. Thus, it should speed up the process of matching with the database and reduce the need for a large amount of unused memory.</p>

								<h2>2D Game Development Project<br/>
								</h2>
								<p>In this project, I will learn all the essentials of 2D game development by creating a game in (Unity) a step-by-step manner throughout the
									University of Houston game development course. Our team (Alterblast) consists of six Computer Science students, with who I am closely working in Discord and Github.
									Throughout this project, we will create characters, make them move, and create some enemies. By the end of this project, we will not only have created a complete great game, but we would be able to learn new skills and work as a team.</p>

								<p>A large section of this project focuses on database management and Tk GUI toolkit. I had to create a database for the banking solution to facilitate its functioning. This system is a GUI console-based system so it is very easy to comprehend and use. System includes all the fundamental features required in a bank.</p>

								<h2>My Interests</h2>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-desktop">
									<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRCjGkDb-EowTwp1OyPAgTw"> My YouTube Channel </a></h3>
									<p>My interest in video making and creativity made me produce my first Youtube channel at 16 years old. With the help of friends and family, I launched about 30 videos over the course of 1 year. Nowadays I pursue video making in a personal level, usually only making birthday and anniversary videos for family and close friends. Although I do not plan to pursue a career in video making, it is a hobby I would like to gain more experience from. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-swimmer">
									<h3>Sports</h3>
									<p>I've always loved active entertainment. My favorite sports are tennis, swimming and Judo. In addition to enjoyment and physical health, playing sports introduce me to many interesting people, whom I met during my practice and competitions.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-dollar-sign">
									<h3>Stocks</h3>
									<p>I started investing my money from an early age, gaining experience and insight into the stock market. For the past few years, I have learned how to manage my money better and created an investing plan for my future. Furthermore, I taught myself to follow two rules: make sure that expenses do not exceed income, and have free funds from the last month be directed to investing. Over the past year, my portfolio has grown by 24%.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-book">
									<h3>Reading</h3>
									<p>A book is a source of knowledge. They accompany me at all stages of my development. Reading them had a positive effect on me. Books broadened my horizons, filled my vocabulary, changed values and even character, and also helped me find a way out in a difficult life situation.</p>
