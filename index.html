								<h2>Python Banking Project<br />
								</h2>
								<p>A large section of this project focuses on database management and Tk GUI toolkit. I had to create a database for the banking solution to facilitate its functioning. This system is a GUI console-based system so it is very easy to comprehend and use. System includes all the fundamental features required in a bank.</p>

								<li class="icon solid fa-desktop">
									<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRCjGkDb-EowTwp1OyPAgTw"> My YouTube Channel </a></h3>
									<p>My interest in video making and creativity made me produce my first Youtube channel at 16 years old. With the help of friends and family, I launched about 30 videos over the course of 1 year. Nowadays I pursue video making in a personal level, usually only making birthday and anniversary videos for family and close friends. Although I do not plan to pursue a career in video making, it is a hobby I would like to gain more experience from. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-swimmer">
									<h3>Sports</h3>
									<p>I've always loved active entertainment. My favorite sports are tennis, swimming and Judo. In addition to enjoyment and physical health, playing sports introduce me to many interesting people, whom I met during my practice and competitions.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-dollar-sign">
									<h3>Stocks</h3>
									<p>I started investing my money from an early age, gaining experience and insight into the stock market. For the past few years, I have learned how to manage my money better and created an investing plan for my future. Furthermore, I taught myself to follow two rules: make sure that expenses do not exceed income, and have free funds from the last month be directed to investing. Over the past year, my portfolio has grown by 24%.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-book">
									<h3>Reading</h3>
									<p>A book is a source of knowledge. They accompany me at all stages of my development. Reading them had a positive effect on me. Books broadened my horizons, filled my vocabulary, changed values and even character, and also helped me find a way out in a difficult life situation.</p>
